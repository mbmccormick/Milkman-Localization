Milkman-Localization
====================

This repository is the open source home for Milkman's language translations. [Milkman](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/milkman/2d14a2ea-9445-4d46-b385-8b2e45f7f6d8) is the premier [Remember The Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) client for the [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/) platform. Milkman currently supports French, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish languages in addition to English. If you'd like to help translate Milkman for your own language, this is the place to do that.

Translations

This section provides guidelines for translating Remember The Milk. If you have any questions about translations, please send an email to feedback@mbmccormick.com or visit the [Translation Guidelines](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/translate/guidelines.rtm) page on the Remember The Milk website.

#### Tone
Milkman in English is written in a friendly, casual style. You do not need to translate literally or word-for-word, but where possible please try to preserve a friendly tone with your translation.

#### Proper Names
Proper names or product names do not need to be translated. Examples of these include "Milkman" and "Remember The Milk".

#### Dates and Times
Please translate any examples of dates and times into your language (users will be able to enter due dates and other dates/times in their own language instead of English).

#### Corrections
Translating Milkman is a collaborative effort – several translators may work on the same language. To help ensure a consistent and high quality translation for each language, we encourage you to correct mistakes or offer improved translations. You can do this by choosing to edit existing translations, and providing a reason for your correction (we manually check corrections) in your commit message.
